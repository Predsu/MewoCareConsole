# MewoCare Console
Hi, welcome to the experimental project of android game "MewoCare" in Windows Terminal. To be clear I am also creator of the original. A bunch of useful information below:
### Compliance with MewoCare
For now it offers basic mechanics from the android version like
- basic four Mewo parameters
- menu
- simple graphics made using ASCII art
- idle time
- sleeping when idle
- money (lack of use for now)

As new updates will come out I will add more things here

### Tools and languages
Languages used: **C#**
Tools used: **VS 2019**, **[ASCII art from image](https://www.asciiart.eu/image-to-ascii)**

### License
I've decided to use GPL-3.0. That means you can even commercially use the code but the project has to be open source

> Current readme version: v0.1
